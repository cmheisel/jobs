Job description: Manager, Software Development
=================================================

Your job is to create an environment and team that delivers outstanding software as fast as possible while having fun.

In addition to other assigned duties, software development managers have two primary areas of responsibility.

Developing a team of direct reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're responsible for a great group of developers and making them greater. You'll evaluate and coach developers to continually improve their performance as both technologists and employees. You've got a great track record of interviewing and hiring fantastically talented folks.

You're also a developer's career advocate: knowing where they want to go and taking the appropriate steps to set them up for success.

You continually survey your developers for those who should be the company's future leaders and get them the experiences, coaching and peers they need to take on a job like yours.

Leading a cross-functional delivery team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a development manager, you'll be accountable for the success of one or more projects assigned to you. Each project will have a cross-team, cross-functional group of folks assigned to it. Your delivery team works closely with a project manager and customer to define the most valuable work and to break it apart into appropriately sized chunks to be delivered.

Delivery teams can include 1 or more of your direct reports, depending on the project's needs and your developer's career paths.

You're accountable for the team's quality, timely delivery and the project's success. You're also the team's advocate within the company, getting them everything they need to be successful. You'll also be an inspiration for innovation to the customer and the team.
